# Device Diagnosis Expert System

**Project goal:** The goal of this project is to create an expert system for automated device failure diagnosis using CLIPS rules engine.

**Important files:** 
- diagnostic-system.clp (main CLIPS rules file)
- README.md (documentation)

**Papers:** Based on rule-based expert systems principles

**To use this system:** Load the CLIPS file and run (start-diagnosis) function. The system will interactively guide through device diagnosis process.
